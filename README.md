## Restic Helper Scripts
Helper scripts to use restic more easily on Linux x86, x64 and ARM (such as Truenas Scale or generic Debian/Ubuntu/Arch etc.).
Scripts might work on BSD if you try that by setting OS to BSD.

### Function
The main `./restic` script downloads the latest restic release into `/tmp/restic` automatically and then calls the binary.
